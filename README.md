Cloning this repo should give direct access to DragonDrop when the server is run, as dragondrop.db is present in the folder.<br>

If not, syncdb, and run populate_dragondrop.py. <br>

The site itself has some help on each screen, but an overview of help follows:<br>

1) Add folders using the link in the left hand column.<br>
2) Search, and if you like a bookmark, drag it into the folder.<br>
3) If you do not like a bookmark, you can drag it into the bin folder and never see it again.<br>
4) Your 5 most recent bookmarks, and the 5 top bookmarks of the site are displayed on the right.<br>
5) Clicking on a folder brings you into the folder page.<br>
6) You can rank the bookmarks, delete them, tweet them, and manually add them.<br>
7) Ranking the bookmarks impacts the output of searching.

Also included in this repository are<br>
